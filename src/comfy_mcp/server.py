"""comfy-mcp — a thin MCP wrapper over comfy-cli.

Every tool shells out to the ``comfy`` command (comfy-cli), pinned to the LOCAL
target (``--where local``, defaulting to ComfyUI on ``127.0.0.1:8188``), asks
for JSON, parses comfy-cli's versioned ``envelope/1`` result, and returns its
``data``. The run/queue tools — and ``upload_file``, which stages the input
files those runs read — can be pointed at a ComfyUI running ELSEWHERE by
setting ``COMFYUI_URL`` / ``COMFYUI_HOST`` (see ``target._comfy_target``), which
forwards ``--host`` / ``--port`` to comfy-cli. A LOCAL ComfyUI on a non-default
address (e.g. ``:8189``) instead needs no code here at all: ``COMFY_LOCAL_URL``
rides the environment passthrough (see ``_comfy_env``) and is resolved by
comfy-cli, which ranks a ``--host``/``--port`` flag above ``COMFY_LOCAL_URL``,
that above a background record, and ``127.0.0.1:8188`` last. ComfyUI itself
is reached only through comfy-cli. This fork's one transport exception is
file ingress: a ChatGPT host file is streamed to a temporary file, and a
Claude/Cursor upload is a direct HTTP PUT into a local spool, and both then
go through ``comfy upload``. Neither path calls ComfyUI's HTTP API.

Tools so far: the run -> get-output core loop plus job management via the
grouped ``job(action=...)`` tool (``"status"`` / ``"wait"`` / ``"watch"`` /
``"error"`` / ``"cancel"`` / ``"queue"``), the ``launch_comfyui`` / ``stop_comfyui`` /
``restart_comfyui`` lifecycle trio (``comfy launch --background`` /
``comfy stop`` / stop-then-launch — the two that forward ``extra_args`` ask the
user to confirm any flag that would publish the unauthenticated local ComfyUI to
the network) with ``get_logs`` (``comfy logs``) to read a
detached launch's captured output, the install verbs ``update_comfyui``
(``comfy update``, forward-only — and its ``target="all"`` rebuilds every
installed third-party node pack, so that target asks the user to confirm),
``switch_comfyui_version``
(``comfy update comfy --version <X>``, which can also roll BACK and so asks the
user to confirm per call) and ``install_node`` (``comfy node install``, the
acquisition half of the missing-node story — it downloads and runs third-party
pack code, so it asks the user to confirm every call), and the
``discover`` / ``which`` introspection pair (``comfy discover`` /
``comfy which``) that lets an agent learn the CLI's own contract and selection.
``partner_generate`` (``comfy generate <model>``) reaches the hosted PARTNER
models; it spends credits, so comfy-cli's own consent interlock gates it and
this wrapper only passes that consent through (``--yes``) when the USER granted
it for that call — asked per call over MCP elicitation, or pre-authorized in
comfy-cli's own config. The durable "always proceed" stays engine-side, so this
server holds no spend state of its own. ``emit_partner_workflow``
(``comfy generate <model> --emit-workflow <path>``) is its local counterpart:
it writes a runnable graph containing the partner's API NODE instead of calling
the proxy, so ``emit_partner_workflow`` -> ``run_workflow`` -> ``fetch_outputs``
runs the partner model on the user's OWN ComfyUI (the other way to get there is
an existing ``API``-tagged gallery template via ``search_templates`` /
``run_template``; this is the path from a model ALIAS). The EMIT step reaches no
partner API and spends nothing, so it carries no consent gate — but the graph it
writes does bill the partner node when it runs, so the ``run_workflow`` that
follows takes the same opt-in ``confirm_spend`` gate ``run_template`` does.

Requires comfy-cli >= 1.14.0 — the release carrying every verb this tool surface
calls, on top of the 1.13.0 basics (the ``comfy logs`` verb, the ``envelope/1``
contract, and the ``login_url`` event ``auth_login`` depends on):
:func:`_run_comfy` guards this once, up front, with an actionable upgrade error
so a stale install fails clearly rather than cryptically.

NOTE: the exact ``comfy`` invocation + envelope shape still need a smoke test
against a real comfy-cli install and a running local ComfyUI.

# on — and it was the floor until 1.14.0 shipped. Against an install below the
# floor a missing verb surfaces as a cryptic "No such command", and `auth_login`
# burns its whole `_LOGIN_URL_WAIT_S` budget before it can say why — so
# `_run_comfy` guards this once, up front, with an upgrade message. `auth_login`
# keeps its own timeout branch as the backstop for an install that slips past the
# guard (which fails OPEN on a `--version` it cannot read).
#
# Raised to 1.14.0 when that release shipped, because a large slice of this
# server's tool surface calls verbs and options that exist only at >= 1.14.0:
# `comfy node deps` + its `--registry` (node_dependencies), `system-stats` /
# `free`, `workflow notes` (list_workflow_notes), `logs --port`, the background
# download group (`model download --background` and its `download-status` /
# `downloads` / `download-cancel` companions), `models search`'s cross-folder
# walk, the `templates` gallery cache TTL, and `comfy run`'s `--allow-spend`
# interlock.
#
# Why that raise was cheap — and why the next one is NOT. At the time this server
# was pre-launch (private repo, nothing on PyPI), so ~nobody could be pinned to the
# previous release, and a floor is only cheap to raise BEFORE you have users. That
# window has CLOSED: comfy-mcp publishes to PyPI as of 0.9.0, so an installed base
# exists and a raise is a BREAKING change for anyone below the new floor — this
# guard refuses up front in `_run_comfy`, it does not degrade per verb. Raise it
# only for a verb or option this tool surface actually CALLS and cannot degrade
# around (the 1.14.0 rationale above), never because a newer comfy-cli merely
# exists: 1.15.0 and 1.16.0 both shipped fixes to verbs called here — restored
# cloud-job error text, live `jobs watch` progress — and neither moved this floor.
# And on 1.13.0 enough of the tool surface is inert that the server reads as BROKEN
# rather than as out-of-date, which is a worse first contact than a clear
# "upgrade comfy-cli" refusal.
#
# Raising the floor does NOT retire the per-verb `{"error": ..., "unsupported":
# true}` degrades, and they were deliberately kept: the floor and a degrade guard
# DIFFERENT failures. The floor catches a WRONG comfy-cli version; a degrade
# catches a CORRECT version in a broken environment. Both halves of that still
# happen at 1.14.0 — this guard fails OPEN, so a source build or fork whose
# `--version` cannot be parsed reaches the tools from below the floor, and a
# dependency OUTSIDE comfy-cli (a ComfyUI-Manager too old to know a flag
# comfy-cli forwarded to it) can fail on an otherwise-compliant install. Same

# after a probe has FINISHED — the startup machine-snapshot probe (a daemon
# thread) is usually first, and every tool call arriving while it is still inside
# its 30s-capped subprocess would otherwise read `_version_checked is False` and
# spawn a redundant cold comfy-cli interpreter, N concurrent first calls spawning
# N of them on exactly the machine least able to afford it. `threading.Lock` (not
# an asyncio one) is correct for both call styles: the sync paths call
# `_check_comfy_version` directly, the async paths via `asyncio.to_thread`, and
# it is never held across an `await`.
#
# Acquired with a BOUND, never unconditionally. The guard's worst case has always
# been per-call and finite; a bare `with` would make it process-wide and
# unbounded, because the holder can exceed the probe's nominal cap (on Windows,
# `subprocess.run`'s post-`kill()` `communicate()` blocks until a leaked
# grandchild closes the inherited handles) and every later `_run_comfy` would
# then queue behind it forever. Giving up latches open ONLY when no probe started
# during the whole wait — the wedge, where it latches for the same reason the
# `TimeoutExpired` branch does and with the same force: a holder that overran its
# cap is a hung `comfy --version` by another route, and without the latch every
# later call would re-pay the full bound, turning a wedged probe into a permanent
# per-call stall — worse than the pre-lock behavior, where whichever caller timed
# out first latched open on everyone's behalf. A waiter that timed out while
# probes were STARTING has no wedge to report, only contention, and the give-up
# branch is careful not to read the two as the same thing; see it for why.
#
# Because the wait and the probe are consecutive, a single contended first call
# can cost the bound PLUS a full probe (~65s) before it answers. That is stated
# at the three `to_thread(_check_comfy_version)` call sites, which is where a

# the whole subtlety. What makes another probe's answer usable is not that it
# finished while you waited — it is that it started AFTER you arrived, because

# asking about. Bumping on completion would let a caller that arrived mid-probe
# replay a verdict computed before it ever called, so an operator who upgrades
# comfy-cli (or grants Full Disk Access) while a probe is in flight would get the

    ``_run_comfy_streaming``) cannot drift. The inherited ``os.environ`` is
    forwarded WHOLESALE on purpose — that passthrough is what lets a variable
    set in the MCP client's ``env`` block configure comfy-cli without any code
    here, e.g. ``COMFY_LOCAL_URL`` to target a local ComfyUI on a non-default
    address (``:8189``) or ``COMFY_API_KEY`` for partner-API nodes. Injected
    keys are placed AFTER ``os.environ`` so they win over any inherited values:

    - ``COMFY_WHERE=local`` — belt-and-suspenders pin so we never touch cloud.
    - ``COMFY_NO_WATCH=1`` — suppress comfy-cli's file watcher for agentic
      callers like this MCP; a harmless no-op on versions that lack the flag.
    - ``COMFY_USER_AGENT=comfy-mcp`` — self-attribution, so usage that
      originates here (partner-node calls above all: ``partner_generate`` ->
      ``comfy generate``, and ``run_workflow`` over a graph carrying partner-API
      nodes -> ``comfy run``) is attributable to this server rather than folded
      into the generic CLI bucket. See :data:`_MCP_USER_AGENT`. It is INJECTED,
      not defaulted — an inherited value (a stale one in the user's shell, or the
      client's own label) would silently mis-attribute calls this server made,
      which is the one thing the label exists to answer. A caller wanting to
      record *which host drove the MCP* wants a second field, not this one.
    - ``PYTHONUTF8=1`` / ``PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`` — force UTF-8 on the child's
      console. Without them a default Windows (cp1252) console raises
      ``UnicodeEncodeError`` printing the UTF-8 catalog output and wedges, so the
      discovery tools present as a 60s timeout. UTF-8 is already the practical
      default on macOS/Linux, so this is a no-op there.
    - ``GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`` / ``PIP_NO_INPUT=1`` — never let a child stop to
      ask a question. This is an MCP **stdio** server, so the parent's stdin is
      the JSON-RPC transport; both spawn sites therefore pass
      ``stdin=DEVNULL`` (see ``_run_comfy_raw`` / ``_run_comfy_streaming``) so a
      child can never read protocol bytes out from under the client. With stdin
      closed, an interactive git/pip prompt could not be answered anyway, so
      these two turn "block invisibly until the timeout" into an immediate,
      legible failure — which matters most for ``update_comfyui``, whose
      ``git pull`` + ``pip install`` can hit an uncached private remote and
      whose 30-minute ceiling makes a silent hang very expensive.

      Deliberately NOT set here: ``GIT_ASKPASS`` / ``SSH_ASKPASS``. A GUI or
      keychain credential helper does not use stdin, so it still works with
      stdin closed; overriding it would break private-remote updates that
      succeed today.

    ``PATH`` is the one inherited variable this rewrites rather than injects
    alongside: the directory of the RESOLVED ``COMFY_BIN`` is guaranteed to be
    on the child's ``PATH``, first. This exists because ``comfy launch
    --background`` re-invokes ``comfy`` by BARE NAME via ``PATH`` (comfy-cli
    1.12's ``launch.py`` spawns ``Popen(["comfy", ...])`` for the detached
    process). Without the prepend, an absolute ``COMFY_BIN`` pointing outside
    the inherited ``PATH`` — the normal state for an MCP server launched by a
    GUI client on macOS — crashes background launch with ``FileNotFoundError:
    'comfy'`` before ComfyUI is ever spawned, surfacing here as the opaque
    ``comfy-cli returned no JSON (exit 1)``. Prepending rather than
    appending is deliberate: it also stops a stale second comfy install earlier
    on the user's ``PATH`` from shadowing the intended one inside the child.
    The entry is absolutized because comfy-cli ``os.chdir``s to the
    workspace in the child before that re-invocation resolves, so a relative
    entry would point somewhere else by then.

    The rewrite is strictly additive and never *shrinks* the child's search
    path: it is skipped outright when the directory cannot be expressed as a
    PATH entry (it contains ``os.pathsep``), and an absent inherited ``PATH``
    falls back to ``os.defpath`` — CPython's own fallback — rather than
    resolving to the binary's directory alone.

    What it cannot fix: comfy-cli re-invokes the literal name ``comfy``, so a
    ``COMFY_BIN`` pointing at a RENAMED binary (``comfy-1.12``) still leaves the
    child's bare-name lookup to find some other ``comfy`` — or none. Hoisting
    the directory is still correct there (a sibling ``comfy`` symlink, the
    common venv shape, then wins), but the residual case belongs upstream: only
    comfy-cli can stop re-invoking by bare name.

def _project_root() -> str | None:
    """Resolve the ``COMFY_PROJECT`` anchor root every comfy-cli spawn's ``cwd=`` uses.

    comfy-cli 1.15.0's ``project/1`` convention (``comfy project init`` /
    ``status``) resolves the GOVERNING project by walking up from its own
    process ``cwd`` only — no ``--project`` flag, no env var it reads itself.
    That assumes a persistent shell session; this server's ``cwd`` is whatever
    the MCP client happened to launch it from, arbitrary and unrelated to any
    project the user cares about. So this server anchors it from the outside:
    every spawn (see the five sites below) passes ``cwd=_project_root()`` to
    its subprocess call, which comfy-cli's own cwd-walk then resolves exactly
    as if that had been the shell's directory all along.

    ``COMFY_PROJECT`` is read from the environment ONCE per process and cached
    (mirrors ``_version_checked``'s once-per-process memoization) — a value
    that changed mid-session must not silently re-anchor calls already in
    flight to a different root. ``None`` (unset) returns ``None``, so every
    spawn's ``cwd=`` argument is ``None`` too — identical to not passing ``cwd``
    at all, i.e. today's behavior, byte for byte.

    A SET value is validated on every call (not cached past the read) — cheap
    (an ``os.path.isabs`` check plus one ``os.path.isdir`` stat), and unlike
    the read this deliberately does NOT latch a bad verdict, so an operator
    who fixes it (``mkdir``) mid-process has the very next spawn pick it up,
    the same "don't memoize the negative" policy `_check_comfy_version` uses
    for a too-old CLI. An invalid root raises :class:`ComfyCliError` rather
    than falling back to unanchored: this feature exists to make
    project-governed behavior deterministic, and a silent fallback would
    reintroduce exactly the non-determinism it removes. The root does NOT need
    to contain ``comfy.yaml`` — an uninitialized directory is valid here;
    that's what the ``project`` tool's ``init`` action is for.

    A RELATIVE value is rejected the same fail-closed way, not silently
    resolved against this server's own ``cwd``: that resolution would depend
    on the same client-assigned, arbitrary launch directory this feature
    exists to stop depending on, so a relative ``COMFY_PROJECT`` would be
    exactly as non-deterministic as leaving it unset while looking configured.

    regardless of which runner produced it, and a wording change lands in both at
    once. Returning rather than raising keeps the ``raise ... from exc`` at the
    call site: each runner stays visibly the thing that fails, its traceback
    starts there rather than inside a formatting helper, and the explicit
    ``from exc`` chaining to the originating ``TimeoutExpired`` /
    ``asyncio.TimeoutError`` stays where that exception is actually bound.

    The stream parameters are typed as widely as what the callers can hand over,
    not as narrowly as the common case: :func:`_run_comfy_async` always decodes to
    ``str`` first, but :func:`_drain_timed_out` can return ``None`` (nothing
    written) or ``bytes`` (POSIX attaches the undecoded partial read to

    The BACKSTOP under every pre-spawn guard, shared by all four spawn sites
    (:func:`_run_comfy_raw`, :func:`_run_comfy_async`,
    :func:`_run_comfy_streaming`, :func:`_start_login`) so a spawn that never
    happened reports identically wherever it was attempted. Returning rather than
    raising is :func:`_timeout_failure`'s rationale verbatim: the
    ``raise ... from exc`` stays at the call site, so each runner remains visibly
    the thing that failed and the chaining sits where the originating exception is
    bound.

    It exists because the spawn call sits OUTSIDE the ``try`` that each runner
    opens around ``communicate()`` / the drain — everything after a successful
    spawn already has a handler, and a spawn that raised has no child to reap. An
    exception from the constructor therefore escaped as an unconverted internal
    error: no :class:`ComfyCliError`, no failure-log line. Reachable in practice
    because MCP tool arguments cross the wire uncapped for the free-form values
    (``search_models``'s ``query``, a ``partner_generate`` param), and a big
    enough one trips the OS limit on ``execve`` — measured on macOS, a ~2 MiB
    argument raises ``OSError: [Errno 7] Argument list too long``.

    The message names the failure CLASS and the rendered command, and adds
    nothing else — in particular no separate echo of the offending value, which
    is by definition the oversized or unencodable one. The rendering is
    :func:`_cmd_for_message`, the same one :func:`_timeout_failure` uses, so the
    argv is credential-scrubbed and head-clipped to
    :data:`errors._MAX_ERROR_FIELD_CHARS`: a megabyte-long "query" cannot come back
    whole, while the identifying ``comfy --json --where local <subcommand>``
    prefix still tells a reader WHICH call could not be started. A value short
    enough to fit inside that clip does appear, exactly as it does in the timeout
    and error-envelope messages — the bound is the contract, not omission.

    Four classes, and the isinstance order is load-bearing:
    :class:`UnicodeEncodeError` is a :class:`ValueError` SUBCLASS, so it has to be
    tested before the bare-``ValueError`` case that names an embedded NUL, or an
    unencodable argument would be reported as the wrong mistake.

    This does NOT replace :func:`argv._reject_nul` / :func:`argv._guard_arg_len`, which
    still run first and still produce the better, argument-NAMING error. What
    lands here is what those cannot see: a value shape they do not cover, an
    environment that pushes the total over ``ARG_MAX``, or the binary vanishing
    between :func:`_require_comfy_bin` and the spawn.

def _kill_proc_tree(proc: subprocess.Popen) -> None:
    """Kill the child *and* any grandchildren it spawned.

    Serves the synchronous spawn site, :func:`_run_comfy_raw`, which passes
    ``start_new_session=True`` so the child leads its own process group and one
    ``killpg`` reaps the whole tree. The async spawn sites
    (:func:`_run_comfy_streaming`, :func:`_start_login`) use the identical
    twin :func:`_kill_proc_tree_async`.

    What is at stake is the work itself: ``comfy update``'s ``git pull`` + ``pip
    install`` and ``comfy model download``'s transfer keep mutating the
    workspace after the tool has already reported a timeout, so they have to die
    with their parent. Killing the group also closes every copy of the stderr
    pipe — comfy-cli can fork a ComfyUI/helper grandchild that inherits the
    write-end, and killing only the direct child leaves that fd open so the
    drain never sees EOF.

    The group kill is UNCONDITIONAL — deliberately NOT gated on ``proc.poll()``.
    A dead leader does not mean a dead tree: the case that matters most is
    precisely the one where ``comfy`` itself has already exited but a forked
    grandchild (``update``'s ``git pull`` / ``pip install``, a ``model
    download``'s transfer) is still running and still holding the pipe open —
    which is *why* ``communicate()`` blew its deadline. A ``poll()`` gate would
    read that survivor's exited parent and skip the kill exactly when the
    descendant most needs reaping, defeating the point of the group. The
    zombie leader keeps the process group alive for its members, so the
    ``killpg`` still lands.

    Callers must therefore invoke this BEFORE anything reaps the child (a
    ``wait``/``poll`` that returns a code). Once reaped, the pid is free for the
    OS to reuse and ``killpg`` could signal an unrelated group; the streaming
    path's two call sites gate on ``proc.poll() is None`` for that reason (they
    can run after a completed ``proc.wait``), while :func:`_run_comfy_raw` calls
    in straight off a ``communicate()`` that never reaped.

    Signals ``proc.pid`` directly rather than ``os.getpgid(proc.pid)``: with
    ``start_new_session=True`` the child IS its own group leader, so the two are
    the same number, and ``getpgid`` on an already-reaped child raises — turning
    the lookup itself into a way to skip the kill.

    Falls back to a plain ``kill`` on Windows / test fakes, where ``killpg`` is
    unavailable. That fallback reaches only the direct child; a Windows tree
    kill needs ``taskkill /T`` or a Job Object and is tracked separately.

    """Async twin of :func:`_run_comfy`: same result contract, cancellable child.

    The same inputs and result shapes as :func:`_run_comfy` — the ``envelope/1``
    unwrap, the ``plain_ok`` synthesis for the verbs that print human text and
    emit no envelope, the :class:`ComfyCliError` shapes — but spawned like
    :func:`_run_comfy_streaming` with :func:`asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`
    instead of a ``Popen`` handed to a worker thread. Nothing here streams; it
    collects the whole output up front and parses it once at the end.

    It collects that output through :func:`_drain_capped_into` rather than with
    ``communicate()``, which is the one place the contract is deliberately
    narrower than :func:`_run_comfy`'s: each stream is bounded to its trailing
    :data:`_STDERR_MAX_CHARS` instead of retained whole. ``communicate()`` is safe
    on the thread-pool path's short metadata calls, but this runner is reserved
    for the LONGEST-LIVED child in the server — up to
    :data:`_DOWNLOAD_SYNC_TIMEOUT` of a multi-GB download's verbose progress text
    — and retaining every byte of that is the unbounded allocation
    :data:`_STDERR_MAX_CHARS` was introduced to prevent for the streaming path.
    Keeping the TAIL loses nothing either consumer needs: comfy-cli's envelope is
    the LAST JSON object it prints and :func:`clitext._synthesize_plain_result` already
    reports only the tail of the printed text. That holds only while the
    envelope itself FITS the tail, so ``stdout_cap`` widens the stdout bound for
    a caller whose envelope scales with its input — ``upload_file``'s echoes
    every staged path back (see :data:`_UPLOAD_STDOUT_MAX_CHARS`). ``None``
    (the default) reads :data:`_STDERR_MAX_CHARS` at call time, so a test
    patching the module constant is still honored.

    That difference is the entire point, and it is about CANCELLATION rather
    than about the event loop. ``asyncio.to_thread(_run_comfy, …)`` is perfectly
    non-blocking, but its cancellation never reaches the thread: an MCP cancel
    notification, or the task-group teardown of a closing stdio session, leaves
    the ``comfy`` child (and the multi-GB transfer or install underneath it)
    running unattended with its partial output on disk. Here the child is a real
    asyncio process, so the ``finally`` below reaps the whole tree on every exit
    path — cancellation included. Use this for a LONG-LIVED plain-JSON call (the
    legacy foreground ``model download``, ``workflow_deps``'s 300s
    network-backed resolve, ``upload_file``'s 300s transfer); short metadata
    calls are fine on the thread-pool path.

    as :func:`_run_comfy` does, so an error envelope raises
    :class:`ComfyCliError` with the same code — terminal behavior is unchanged.

    ``timeout`` bounds the whole stream. By default an expiry raises
    :class:`ComfyCliError` (the run-workflow contract); pass

    the probe can never take ``server_info`` down with it; it degrades to one of
    two shapes instead.

    The MISSING-VERB degrade is its own shape: ``comfy outdated`` ships in
    comfy-cli 1.13.0, below the floor this server enforces
    (:data:`_MIN_COMFY_CLI`), so a compliant install answers this probe. It stays
    as a degrade because the version guard fails OPEN — an install whose
    ``comfy --version`` can't be
    parsed (a source build, a fork) reaches here below the floor, and
    Click/Typer's raw ``No such command 'outdated'.`` usage dump, relayed
    verbatim, reads like a broken MCP rather than the benign capability gap it
    is. That case returns
    ``{"error": "freshness unavailable: ...", "unsupported": True}``, with
    ``unsupported`` machine-readable so a client can branch on it without
    matching strings. :func:`clitext._is_missing_verb_error` decides that case, and is
    deliberately strict: this degrade asserts nothing is broken, so a failure
    that merely *relays* a "no such command" from somewhere else must keep the
    raw passthrough below rather than be waved through as a capability gap.

    EVERY OTHER failure keeps the raw ``{"error": "<reason>"}`` passthrough — for
    a network failure, a timeout, or a decode error the underlying reason IS the
    diagnostic, so relaying it is the useful thing to do. ``OSError`` is caught
    because a spawn failure on this second subprocess (the env probe already
    succeeded) is still just the freshness probe failing, never grounds to fail
    ``server_info``. ``UnicodeDecodeError`` is caught too: ``_run_comfy_raw``
    decodes the child's stdout with strict ``encoding="utf-8"`` (no
    ``errors="replace"``), so non-UTF-8 bytes in a pack name/path from the
    user's live custom-node install can raise it here, same as the other probe

          prefer a practical draft the graph supports, keep the seed and
          other unrelated settings when refining, and inspect the output
          before raising resolution, quality, or cost. The handshake states
          that policy; do not force a draft the user already refused.
        - Without consent, a paid workflow fails CLOSED
          (``spend_consent_required``, nothing spent) on a comfy-cli carrying
          the gate — the enforced floor; a source build past the fail-open
          floor check may lack it and still spend.
        - A workflow requesting a huge allocation can pass validation and then
          crash the whole ComfyUI process on OOM — surfaced as
          connection-loss/timeout, not a node error; ``get_logs`` still reads
          the log across the crash.

# is not affirmatively approved — correct, and unchanged. But the clients agents
# actually run under (Claude Code, Codex CLI, both verified) answer the
# elicitation WITHOUT rendering a prompt, so in practice no human is ever asked
# and five tools are unusable: install_node, update_comfyui(target="all"),
# switch_comfyui_version, restart_comfyui's kill-untracked, and launch with
# --listen. The terminal escape hatch each error names is a real answer, but it
# is not one an agent can take.
#
# WHY AN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE, and not a tool argument. A tool argument is set by
# the AGENT, so honouring one would let the agent consent on the user's behalf —
# exactly what these gates exist to prevent, and what the fallback comments
# elsewhere in this file warn against. This variable lives in the SERVER's
# environment, written by whoever configured the MCP server (mcp.json, a shell
# profile, a container spec). The model cannot set it. So it is a human granting
# consent out-of-band at configuration time, which is the property the
# elicitation was reaching for in the first place.
#
# WHY SPEND IS EXCLUDED. The spend gates carry no `consent_token`, so no value of
# this variable — including "all" — can pre-authorize them. Money already has a
# durable, human-set route in comfy-cli itself (`comfy generate consent always`,
# read via `_engine_auto_confirms`), and a second mechanism would split that
# policy across two places. Keeping one owner for the spend decision matters more
# than the symmetry.
#
# The value is a COMMA-SEPARATED LIST of gate tokens, or "all". A list rather than
# a boolean so the operator states what they are authorizing: enabling node

    The precedence, and the reason for it:

    1. **The engine's durable always-proceed** (``spend.auto_confirm``) wins. The

    2. **Elicitation**, unless the client is KNOWN not to support it — the
       per-call human confirmation this tool is built around. Approve forwards
       ``--yes``; decline raises here, so the refusal is enforced BEFORE
       comfy-cli runs rather than relying on the engine to fail closed
       afterwards. A capability probe that could not answer counts as "ask":
       being wrong that way costs a prompt, the other way costs money.
    3. **The explicit ``confirm_spend`` argument**, only as the fallback for a
       client that cannot elicit. Left ``False`` (the default) nothing is
       forwarded and comfy-cli's own gate fails closed.

    Note what is NOT in that list: the agent host's permission to CALL this
    tool. Spend consent and tool permission are different questions, and an
    "always allow this tool" toggle answers only the second — so on an
    elicitation-capable client the prompt is raised even when the caller passed

    deliberately skips :func:`_require_spend_gate` — spending nothing means there
    is nothing to gate. That is true only if the INSTALLED comfy-cli recognises
    ``--emit-workflow`` as a run-level flag at all. ``comfy generate`` is
    registered with Click's ``ignore_unknown_options``/``allow_extra_args``, so on
    a comfy-cli that predates the flag it is instead forwarded as a MODEL
    PARAMETER and the real, spending proxy call runs — silently, from a tool
    whose contract says it spends nothing and which therefore never raises the
    per-call consent prompt :func:`partner_generate` does.

    :data:`_MIN_COMFY_CLI` is the release that added the SPEND GATE, not
    necessarily the release that added ``--emit-workflow`` (they are unrelated
    features that happened to land in the same command), and
    :func:`_check_comfy_version` fails OPEN on a ``--version`` it cannot read (a
    fork, a source build) — so neither the floor nor the version guard can PROVE
    the flag exists. This probe can.

    The probe runs ``comfy generate --help`` — no model, no params — and checks
    its printed usage for ``--emit-workflow``. That specific invocation is safe
    on ANY comfy-cli, capable or not: with no target positional, ``comfy
    generate``'s own entry point takes the built-in "print help and exit" branch
    before it ever reaches model dispatch or the meta-flag/param split that would
    treat an unrecognised flag as a proxy call. Probing with the real
    ``--emit-workflow`` flag against a live model, by contrast, would on an
    incapable install BE the unguarded spending call this function exists to
    prevent — so this deliberately does not do that.

    the same shape, which differs from :func:`_resolve_spend_consent`'s on two
    points, and only in the message text:

    1. **No prompt when nothing can be spent.** ``confirm_spend=False`` forwards
       nothing, so comfy-cli's gate fails closed and a paid graph cannot spend;
       there is nothing to consent to. Prompting on every call would train the
       user to click through the one prompt that matters, so the prompt is
       raised only when the caller is actually asking to unlock spending.
    2. **comfy-cli's durable always-proceed does NOT apply.** Neither
       ``run-template`` nor ``run`` reads ``spend.auto_confirm`` — the setting is
       scoped to ``comfy generate`` (it is that gate's own configuration surface,
       and its own status line says so). Unlike :func:`_resolve_spend_consent`
       there is therefore no branch that lets the engine consent to itself: it
       would send no flag and the run would fail closed anyway, having asked
       nobody.

    One body rather than one per verb because the part that must not drift is
    the POLICY — what counts as consent, and that a refusal raises here instead
    of relying on the engine. That is the same reasoning that put every gate's
    fail-closed handling in :func:`_elicit_approval`; ``schema`` / ``prompt`` /
    ``declined`` are this level's ``_ApprovalWording``.

    first-seen order, deduped — empty when the args keep the server private,
    which is the case for every flag this server has ever forwarded by default
    and for the overwhelmingly common ``["--port", "8189"]``.

    Why these two flags specifically: the local ComfyUI has NO authentication, so
    ``--listen`` on a non-loopback address hands its full HTTP API — arbitrary
    workflow execution, and file reads/writes under the ComfyUI directory — to
    anything that can route to this machine, and ``--enable-cors-header`` lets a
    web page the user merely VISITS drive that API from their browser. Everything
    else (``--port``, ``--cpu``, ``--lowvram``, …) passes through untouched.

    The loopback carve-out is what keeps this gate from being noise. ``--listen
    127.0.0.1`` is not exposure — it is the DEFAULT bind, spelled explicitly —
    and a caller pinning it (or ``::1``, or ``localhost``, or the comma-joined
    pair) is asking for *less* reach than a bare launch, not more. Prompting
    there would train users to click through the prompt that actually matters.

    Three deliberate over-rejections, so none reads as an oversight:

    - **A repeated ``--listen`` where an EARLIER value was public.** argparse
      keeps the last value, so ``--listen 0.0.0.0 --listen 127.0.0.1`` would in
      fact bind loopback. It is flagged anyway: contradictory binds are a caller
      mistake worth a prompt, and last-wins arithmetic is the kind of subtlety a
      security gate should not stake itself on.
    - **``--enable-cors-header`` with an explicit origin.** Only the bare form
      means ``*``, but even a named origin is a cross-origin grant this server
      will not make on the user's behalf.
    - **A flag after a bare ``--``.** argparse stops option parsing at ``--``, so
      ``["--", "--listen", "0.0.0.0"]`` would reach ComfyUI as positional junk and
      never set ``args.listen``. The scan does not honor the terminator: it would
      have to re-implement how ComfyUI's parser (and comfy-cli's own ``--``
      forwarding, which already consumed one separator to get here) treat a
      second one, and guessing that wrong in the *other* direction is what
      publishes an API. Prompting for arguments that were going to be rejected

       an unauthenticated API on their network, and an "always allow this tool"
       toggle answers only the first. This gate exists precisely because the
       caller may be a prompt-injected agent, so the caller's own assertion can
       never be the authority on a promptable client.
    2. **An unknown capability counts as CAPABLE.** ``None`` from
       :func:`_client_elicitation_support` is the probe failing, not a "no";
       guessing "cannot elicit" would silently demote a real client onto the

       a refusal at :data:`_ELICIT_TIMEOUT`, having started nothing.

    Without it comfy-cli reports success on a failed install: ``node install``
    passes ``raise_on_error=exit_on_fail`` into ``execute_cm_cli``, whose handler
    swallows a ``CalledProcessError`` with ``returncode == 1`` — it prints the
    failure to stderr and returns ``None``, so the command exits 0. A tool that
    omitted the flag would tell an agent the pack is installed when it is not, and
    the agent's next call would fail somewhere much less informative.

    The flag is nevertheless NOT enough on its own, which is the correction to
    what this docstring used to imply. A failed install can still exit 0 with the
    flag passed, because the flag is consulted one layer BELOW where the failure
    is decided: ComfyUI-Manager's ``cm-cli.py`` runs each pack through
    ``for_each_nodes``, which wraps the per-pack call in ``except Exception`` —
    printing ``ERROR: <e>`` and moving to the next pack — and its ``install_node``
    prints its failure sentence BEFORE it consults ``exit_on_fail`` at all. So the
    exit status reports whether the RUN got that far, not whether the packs
    landed. That is not a reading of the source alone: installing a pack id that
    does not exist reproduces it — cm-cli prints ``ERROR: An error occurred while
    installing '<id>'.`` and ``Node '<id>@unknown' not found in [...]``, nothing
    is written to ``custom_nodes/``, and the command exits 0.

    Hence :func:`clitext._extract_install_failures`, which reads the verdict where
    cm-cli actually puts it, and :func:`clitext._classify_install_result`, which turns it
    into this tool's ``installed`` / ``failed`` split. The flag stays because it
    still converts every failure that DOES reach comfy-cli's own handler into a
    raise, which is strictly better than a text match; the text match is what
    covers the rest.

    What this server's comfy-cli floor (1.14.0) establishes is narrower than "the
    flag works", and worth stating exactly, because there is no capability degrade
    written for it. The floor guarantees two things: comfy-cli's own parser ACCEPTS
    ``--exit-on-fail``, and comfy-cli itself acts on it (it is what sets
    ``raise_on_error``, which is what makes a non-zero exit reach this wrapper at
    all). What it does NOT establish is the other end: the flag is also forwarded
    verbatim to ComfyUI-Manager's ``cm_cli``, whose version is a property of the
    user's ComfyUI install rather than of comfy-cli, so a Manager old enough not to
    know the option fails EVERY call here with its own usage error — relayed raw,
    with no remap of the kind :func:`_run_version_switch` writes for
    ``--version`` (:func:`clitext._is_missing_option_error`). That is accepted rather than
    handled because comfy-cli's own e2e suite exercises the flag, so in practice
    the Manager floor travels with the comfy-cli floor; it is not something this
    docstring can claim the version pin proves.

    Like ``launch``/``stop``/``update``, ``node install`` prints human text and
    emits no envelope — ``execute_cm_cli`` writes the node manager's output
    straight to stdout, which under ``--json`` is the envelope channel — so this
    takes ``plain_ok=True`` and returns that text rather than structured rows.
    That is a real thinness cost, and the honest fix is a comfy-cli change adding
    an envelope to the verb, not synthesis here.

    ``MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS``, default 25,000) by TRUNCATING mid-JSON, so an
    oversized reply comes back broken rather than short:

    - ``discover()`` — the default. Capabilities, version, command schemas, and
      a ``schema_index`` of names. A couple of KB; always under the cap.
    - ``discover(command="run")`` — one schema body (~1.6 KB).
    - ``discover(schemas_only=False)`` — the entire surface, ``commands`` tree
      and ``error_codes`` included. Big; only for a client with a raised cap.

    The default USED to return all 35 schema bodies — ~63 KB from the CLI and
    ~109 KB once pretty-printed, which exceeded a standard cap and made the tool
    uncallable at its own default. Measured on comfy-cli 1.15.0.

        exclude_api: drop ``API``-tagged rows.
        limit/offset: page results (``limit`` capped at 200).

    The verdict stays comfy-cli's: ``valid``, the counts and every field are its

    concerns ride on top, both about the WIRE rather than about the answer:

    * **Bounded** — findings clipped to ``_VALIDATE_MAX_FINDINGS`` and each
      finding's option lists to ``_VALIDATE_MAX_OPTIONS``, each clip flagged with
      a ``<key>_truncated`` marker so a caller never mistakes a clipped list for

      caps cannot see — any OTHER list, every string, and nesting depth.
      ``error_count`` / ``warning_count`` are untouched, so they stay the real
      totals.
    * **Masked** — :func:`_bounded_report_value` again: findings quote the
      offending widget VALUE, and a workflow input can be a URL with userinfo in
      it, so every string takes the mask ``_scrub_deps_manifest`` applies for
      the same reason. This report goes straight into the model's transcript.
      The mask anchors on ``https?://``, so it is a no-op on the ordinary
      finding — and where it does fire it also drops the URL's query string, the
      same CivitAI-``?token=`` trade every other masked path here already makes.

    Clipping whole findings runs first only to save the walk some work: it
    removes whole elements, never a partial token, so it cannot leave a URL
    split where the scrubber can no longer anchor on it. The one place that
    ordering is load-bearing — character clipping — is inside
    :func:`_bounded_report_value`, which masks each string before clipping it.

    """``nodes(action="path")``'s body — ``nodes_path`` plus a mode fallback.

    Two passthroughs, and the ONLY thing decided here is which of comfy-cli's
    two traversal modes the installed engine can be trusted to answer in. Both
    are the engine's own walk over the live ``object_info`` graph and the
    payload is relayed verbatim either way, so this stays inside the
    thin-wrapper rule: no graph is parsed here and no verdict is derived here.

    **Why a fallback at all.** comfy-cli's ``--exact`` default was not always
    type-constrained. Before comfy-cli #695 (released in 1.16.0) its
    ``exact_paths`` walked EVERY node and admitted any whose *required link
    inputs* were already satisfied — vacuously true of a node with no link
    inputs at all. So it answered with widget-only loaders and generators that
    never consume ``from_type``, reported their step's ``from_type`` as the
    empty string (it had no consumed type to name), and burned ``max_paths`` on
    them before a real route was reached. This server's floor is comfy-cli
    1.14.0, so that engine is inside the supported range, and the payload it
    produces is the right shape and the wrong answer — indistinguishable from a
    correct one to a caller that cannot re-derive it. Measured against
    comfy-cli's own ``nodes_path_object_info`` fixture on the pre-fix engine:
    ``MODEL`` -> ``IMAGE`` returns ``ByteDanceImageNode`` (which takes no MODEL
    link) and omits ``KSampler -> VAEDecode`` entirely, and the routeless
    ``IMAGE`` -> ``MODEL`` comes back as a bare ``CheckpointLoaderSimple``
    instead of as no answer.

    ``--loose`` on that same engine is sound: it walks the consumers index,
    which is keyed on socket type and built from link inputs only (an
    enum/COMBO widget is not a link), so every step genuinely accepts the type
    the step before it produced, every step names that type, and an unroutable
    pair comes back as no paths. On the fixture it gives
    ``KSampler -> VAEDecode`` and nothing for ``IMAGE`` -> ``MODEL``.

    **Why not just pin ``--loose``.** On a post-fix engine ``--exact`` is
    type-constrained too — it is loose PLUS a satisfiability filter — and it
    answers strictly better: it reports each path's other required inputs under
    ``support`` (the ``VAE`` for ``VAEDecode``, and which node can supply it),
    and it is the only mode that can claim ``exact: true``, which on an empty
    result is a PROOF that no route exists rather than merely no route found.
    Pinning ``--loose`` unconditionally would take both away from every
    up-to-date install to fix an engine most of them are not running, and would
    reinstate a milder version of the same complaint — routes whose steps
    cannot actually be wired.

    So: ask in the default mode, and re-ask in ``--loose`` only when the answer
    comes back in the pre-fix contract
    (:func:`_nodes_path_is_type_constrained`). An up-to-date engine pays
    exactly one call and behaves as it does today; a pre-fix engine pays a
    second call and gets a sound answer instead of a plausible-looking wrong
    one. The verdict is re-read per call rather than latched, matching this
    module's "never memoize the negative" policy — an engine upgraded under a
    running server is picked up on the next call, not on the next restart.

    The flag itself needs no capability probe, unlike ``run_workflow``'s
    ``--allow-spend``: ``nodes path``, ``--exact/--loose`` and the ``envelope/1``
    contract ``_run_comfy`` itself requires all landed in the SAME comfy-cli
    commit, so no engine this server can talk to has the verb without the flag.
    A source build or a fork could still carry the verb without the option, and
    that one shape degrades the way every other option-shaped gap in this module
    does (``--registry``, ``--background``, ``--host``/``--port``): Click's
    ``No such option: --loose`` is caught and the FIRST payload is returned
    instead. That is not a retreat from the fix — on an engine with no
    ``--loose`` there is no sounder answer to be had, so the choice is between
    this file's behavior before this change and no answer at all, and the
    degrade is narrow enough (:func:`clitext._is_missing_option_error`, minus a
    phrase :func:`clitext._phrase_is_only_the_caller_s` shows the caller merely
    echoed through ``from_type``/``to_type``) that it cannot swallow the errors
    that MUST propagate. A timeout on the re-ask, or ComfyUI going away between
    the two spawns, is re-raised: there the engine HAS a sound mode and simply
    did not answer, and relaying the discarded payload would hand back the
    plausible-looking wrong route this function exists to withhold, with nothing
    in it to say so.

    Neither mode is exposed as a caller-facing toggle. ``--exact`` is what a
    caller gets wherever it is trustworthy, and offering the pre-fix engine's
    version of it would hand an agent a mode whose wrong answers it has no way
    to spot. Nor is a "the fallback fired" flag synthesized into the reply —
    that would be this repo deriving a field comfy-cli did not emit, and the
    marker already IS the signal in both directions: a payload with ``mode`` was
    answered in the engine's own default, one without it was answered by the
    ``--loose`` re-ask (and correspondingly carries no ``support`` and no
    ``exact: true``).

    ``model download-status`` / ``model downloads`` payloads. An agent that

    had to know to rename the key — a discovery failure that fails quietly

    the engine's ``id`` would reopen the very disagreement above: the timed-out

    carry different values for one handle. It cannot clobber a DIFFERENT
    handle either: the one caller that passes a value the payload also carries

    :func:`_freshness_report` established, or ``None`` when *exc* is any other
    failure and must be re-raised untouched.

    ``download_model`` already degrades for the OPTION-shaped half of this same
    version gap (``--background``, see :func:`clitext._is_missing_option_error`); this is
    the VERB-shaped half, for the ``model download-status`` / ``download-cancel``
    companions. The three ship as one group, in comfy-cli 1.14.0 — which is also
    this repo's floor (:data:`_MIN_COMFY_CLI`), so a compliant install has all
    three and this is an edge path rather than the common one it was under the
    1.13.0 floor. It stays because the floor guard fails OPEN: a source build or
    fork whose ``--version`` cannot be parsed reaches these tools from below the
    floor, and there they hit Click's raw usage dump, which reads like a broken
    MCP rather than the version gap it is.

    This degrade REPORTS NO LOST CAPABILITY, which is why it is safe. The verb
    group is all-or-nothing, so a CLI missing these two also rejects
    ``--background`` — no ``download_id`` can ever have been minted on it (the
    fallback's synthesized payload carries none), leaving nothing for these tools
    to have acted on. Downloading still works on such a CLI, inline, via
    ``download_model`` itself, and the message says so rather than dead-ending.

    :func:`clitext._is_missing_verb_error` decides the case and is deliberately strict
    for the reason documented there: this shape asserts nothing is broken, so a
    failure that merely RELAYS a "no such command" — or any real error from a
    verb comfy-cli did dispatch, an unknown id included — must keep the raw
    passthrough instead of being waved through as a capability gap. On top of
    that, the caller's own *download_id* is discounted the way
    ``node_dependencies`` discounts ``pack`` / ``registry_id``: every verb here
    takes the id as a bare positional and :func:`argv._guard_download_id`
    deliberately permits any characters, so a Click usage error echoing it back
    could otherwise carry the parser's own phrase. *download_id* is a required
    argument rather than a defaulted one so a fourth caller cannot silently skip
    the subtraction.

    Two modes, exactly one per call. A ChatGPT host file (``file``) is

    With no ``file``, pass ``filename``, ``file_size``, and ``mime_type`` to
    open a direct PUT session (``kind="upload_initialized"``); stream the
    original bytes with the returned curl command, then call
    ``complete_upload``. Bytes never travel through MCP, base64, or tool
    arguments.

    ``comfy upload`` accepted (``uploads[].cloud_name``) — and never the
    client path, ``/mnt/user-data/uploads/...``, the upload spool, or a
    temporary file.

    Args:
        file: ChatGPT host file (``download_url``, ``file_id``, optional
            ``mime_type`` and ``file_name``). Omit it for a direct PUT.

        file_size: Exact original byte count. Required when ``file`` is omitted.
        mime_type: Declared type/subtype such as ``image/png``. Metadata only.
        overwrite: True replaces an existing ComfyUI input of the same name.
            Captured now and reused by ``complete_upload``.

    Gotchas:
    - Claude/Cursor: size is ``wc -c < "$FILE"``, MIME is
      ``file --mime-type -b "$FILE"``, then run the returned curl with the
      real local path in ``$FILE``, then ``complete_upload(upload_id)``.
    - Do not ask the user to copy the file into ComfyUI when the client can
      run that curl.
    - When the target workflow is already known, an oversized reference
      should be resized or cropped to that workflow's useful ratio and
      resolution before transfer. A downscale that keeps the framing is not
      a user decision; a crop that would change the composition is. The

    heavy local runs on machines the policy would have routed to
    partner/cloud. So the handshake itself carries the data: probe ``comfy env``
    once at startup and render its ``hardware`` block (plus the resolved remote
    target, whose presence flips routing STEP 1) into the instructions every
    client receives.

    Thin-wrapper guardrail (AGENTS.md): nothing is DERIVED here. The block is

    into the one surface this repo legitimately owns, the MCP handshake. The

    reads the same) is different from a failed probe and says so: that is
    routing STEP 3's UNKNOWN, and stating it in the snapshot spares the agent a
    ``server_info`` round trip that would report the same.

    comfy-cli caches the gallery index (``~/.cache/comfy-cli/gallery/index.json``,
    24h TTL) and refreshes a merely STALE cache in a detached background
    process — but an ABSENT or corrupt cache is fetched SYNCHRONOUSLY inside
    the command, on a network timeout of its own. So on a fresh machine the
    first :func:`search_templates` pays a cold comfy-cli start PLUS that fetch
    inside its own request window, and a QA pass under parallel load watched
    cold first calls like this one stack up into client-side transport
    timeouts. This moves that cost off the request path, the same way
    :func:`_apply_startup_instructions`' probe already pre-pays the
    ``comfy --version`` gate and the interpreter/page cache — leaving the
    gallery the one cold component still billed to a caller.

    ``templates ls``, NOT ``templates refresh``: ``ls`` is a no-op fetch-wise
    when the cache is present and fresh (it fetches only when the cache is
    absent or corrupt, and stale-refreshes detached), while ``refresh`` forces
    a network fetch on EVERY startup — which is the opposite trade for a
    machine that is already warm.

    Best-effort in every direction. The result is discarded; every failure this
    tolerates (the same set :func:`_machine_snapshot_block` tolerates) returns
    silently, because a warm that fails costs nothing but the cold first call
    the caller would have paid anyway. SILENTLY includes the failure log: the
    whole body runs inside :func:`failure_log._unattributed_calls`, because that
    log exists to explain a call the user actually made and nothing about this
    one is ever surfaced to anybody. (The snapshot probe above is unprompted
    too, but its result rides the handshake, so a record explaining why it came
    back degraded is worth its line; it keeps writing them.) Suppressing only
    ``binary_missing`` (which the ``shutil.which`` short-circuit below happens
    to do) would leave ``timeout`` / ``spawn_failed`` / ``no_json`` /
    ``error_envelope`` writing a record at EVERY startup on an offline or slow
    host, spending the log's fixed rotation budget evicting real diagnostics.
    The ``which`` check stays because it is also a cheap skip — no error path,
    no macOS TCC stat walk — on the machine that has no comfy-cli at all.

    Same 60s cap ``search_templates`` gives the identical command
    (:data:`_run_comfy`'s house timeout for a metadata call), and deliberately
    NOT a shorter one: the warm exists precisely for the cold-cache case, so it
    is the invocation MOST likely to need the fetch's full budget, and a warm
    that expires is worse than a slow one — ``_run_comfy_raw`` SIGKILLs the
    process group on expiry, which can land mid-write of comfy-cli's
    ``index.json`` and leave behind exactly the corrupt cache named at the top
    of this docstring, making the NEXT ``search_templates`` slower rather than
    faster.
    It is a SUBPROCESS cap either way, never a startup stall: ``main()`` starts
    this on a daemon thread and nothing ever joins it, so this function cannot
    delay the initialize response however long it takes.

    Not joining has a shutdown consequence worth stating: when ``mcp.run()``
    returns because the client closed stdin, the interpreter finalizes while
    this thread may still be parked in ``communicate()``, so its own
    timeout/kill path never runs and the ``comfy templates ls`` child — spawned
    ``start_new_session=True`` — is orphaned in its own process group. That is
    tolerated rather than reaped: this is comfy-cli's most read-only verb, it
    mutates nothing but its own cache, and it exits on its own, so the orphan
    just finishes the warm we wanted. It is also not new — the snapshot probe
    above already outlives its bounded join the same way. What would NOT be
    tolerable here is a mutating verb (the reason :func:`_kill_proc_tree`
    exists for ``update`` / ``model download``); keep this thread on verbs of
