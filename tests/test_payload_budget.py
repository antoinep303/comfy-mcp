"""Ceiling on the LLM-facing payload: tool docstrings + handshake instructions.

Every MCP session ships every tool description plus INSTRUCTIONS before any
work happens. After a three-pass docstring diet, the payload is approximately
15.1k estimated tokens — a fixed tax on every conversation. This test freezes
a ceiling just above the measured size so growth is a deliberate decision (bump
the constant in the same PR, with justification), and the ceiling ratchets DOWN
as further trims land.

Token estimate: len(chars) / 4 — crude but stable, and only deltas matter.
Docstrings are collected via AST rather than SDK introspection so the test
does not depend on MCP SDK internals.

# Ceiling, in estimated tokens (chars/4). Measured 2026-08-07 after the
# tool-consolidation series' third and final commit (`nodes(action=...)`,
# 47 -> 39 tools): ~13.84k (39 tool docstrings, 40248 doc chars + INSTRUCTIONS
# 15126 chars). Ratcheted 17,000 -> 15,000 accordingly — comfortably above the
# measurement so ordinary edits never trip it while real growth does. Ratchet
# DOWN as the docstring diet lands; never bump without stating why in the same
# PR.
#
# 15,000 -> 15,250 when `nodes` documented `is_api_node` / `exclude_api`: that
# paragraph is ~130 tokens and the tree was ALREADY at 14,984, so the slack the
# ratchet was set with had been spent by intervening docstring growth rather
# than by this change. Measured ~15,112 after it. Deliberately tight — the
# point of this ceiling is that the next growth is a decision too, not that
# there is room for one.
#
# 15,250 -> 15,400 for `generate_image`'s expired-wait contract (+~145 tokens
# across its docstring and the long-generation flow in INSTRUCTIONS). Growth a
# caller cannot do without: that a `wait=True` call is bounded by the CLIENT's
# invisible transport cap as much as by `timeout_seconds`, and that an expired
# wait returns the `prompt_id` of a job that is still running rather than
# failing, is not inferable from any other tool's docs — and an agent that does
# not know it re-runs a generation that is already on the GPU. Measured ~15,256
# after the edit, itself already trimmed twice against this ceiling.
#
# 15,400 -> 15,650 when `billing_status` was added on top of that. This one is
# a whole new TOOL, not docstring growth on an existing one: its description
# is ~1,110 chars, which is the mean length of the 39 that were already here,
# so there was no version of it that fit the slack left after the
# `generate_image` bump. Measured ~15,596 after it (40 tool docstrings), so the
# next growth is still a decision.
#
# 15,650 -> 16,400 when direct upload added `init_upload` and `complete_upload`
# plus the handshake's three-way file sequence. Two tools, and a sequence an
# agent cannot infer from `upload_file`: a ChatGPT host file completes in
# `init_upload`, a Claude/Cursor file is a direct PUT of the original bytes
# then `complete_upload`, and the next workflow uses `comfy_filename`.
# Measured ~16,308 after it (42 tool docstrings).
#
# 16,400 -> 18,300 when the handshake gained the creative-assistant policy
# (draft before quality, seed comparability, reference preparation, one
# recommendation from the live install, inspect before escalation) plus a
# short pointer on the generation tools and `init_upload`. That policy is
# handshake text an agent cannot infer from the tool list. No new tool.
# Measured ~18,138 after it (42 tool docstrings, 49446 doc chars +
# INSTRUCTIONS 23108 chars). The slack is the next growth's decision.
