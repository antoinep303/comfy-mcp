"""Shared pytest fixtures.

The comfy-cli version guard (`server._check_comfy_version`) shells out to
`comfy --version` once per process from inside `_run_comfy`. The unit tests stub
the comfy-cli spawn to emit canned envelopes and assert the exact argv — a stray
`comfy --version` call would consume that stub and pollute those assertions. So
by default we mark the guard "already checked" for every test; the dedicated
guard tests (`test_wrapper.py`) re-enable it explicitly and mock `--version`.
``partner_generate``'s spend-gate probe and ``emit_partner_workflow``'s
capability probe are two more such once-per-process shell-outs, each
neutralized the same way.

This module also holds the shared test helpers for both comfy-cli spawn paths,
so a change to how ``server`` shells out lands in ONE fake rather than in a
copy per test file:

* the plain ``--json`` path (``subprocess.Popen`` + a bounded
  ``communicate``) — ``envelope`` + ``patched_run`` / ``patched_plain_run``;
* the streaming ``--json-stream`` path
  (``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`` + incremental stream reads) —
  ``patched_stream``, plus ``blocking_stream`` for the timeout paths (a child
  that emits some lines and then blocks past the caller's deadline).
  ``run_workflow``, ``job(action="watch")`` and ``generate_image`` all drive the
  same NDJSON stream.
* the plain-JSON ASYNC path (``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`` + bounded drains
  of both pipes) — ``patched_async_run``, for ``server._run_comfy_async``. Same
  spawn and same real ``StreamReader`` pipes as the streaming fake, but the output
  is parsed once at the end rather than read line-by-line;
  ``download_model``'s legacy foreground fallback, ``workflow_deps`` and
  ``upload_file`` drive it.

Every path spawns with ``start_new_session=True`` so a timeout can kill the whole
process group; the fakes model that too (see ``_FakeRunProc``). All three also
accept and record ``cwd`` — the ``COMFY_PROJECT`` anchor ``server._project_root``
resolves (``None`` when unset) — so `test_project.py` can assert it landed on
every spawn path without a fourth fake.

The streaming fakes back their pipes with REAL :class:`asyncio.StreamReader`
objects (``stream_reader``) rather than a hand-rolled awaitable. The reader's
buffer-limit behavior is load-bearing for ``server._readline_unbounded``, so a
stub that merely returned canned lines would test nothing about the one thing
that path exists to handle.

    The one case ``patched_stream`` cannot model: its ``_FakeProc`` drains a

    never hold a read past a deadline. Here BOTH pipes are left open, because a
    child that is still running has EOF'd neither, and ``returncode`` starts
    None so the timeout handler's kill actually fires. No ``pid``, so
    ``server._kill_proc_tree_async`` takes the ``proc.kill()`` fallback instead
    of signalling a made-up process group — same reasoning as :class:`_FakeProc`.

    ``wait()`` does NOT return until the child terminates, and ``kill()`` is what
    terminates it: it closes both pipes and sets ``returncode``, exactly as
    :class:`_FakeAsyncRunProc` does and for the same reason — killing the process
    GROUP drops every inherited copy of the write fd, which is the only thing
    that lets a post-kill drain reach EOF instead of blocking. That fidelity is
    what holds ``_run_comfy_streaming``'s ordering under test: it kills the tree
    FIRST and only then re-awaits the bounded stderr drain, so a fake whose
    stderr had already EOF'd would stay green with the kill removed, and one
    whose ``wait()`` returned early would stay green with the wait moved ahead of
    the kill — while a real child wedged on both counts.

    ``server._run_comfy_async`` spawns exactly like the streaming runner and, like

    ``communicate()`` would — so its pipes are REAL
    :class:`asyncio.StreamReader`s here too (see :func:`stream_reader`), fed the
    canned output. What differs from :class:`_FakeProc` is only that nothing is
    read line-by-line: the runner parses the whole capture once at the end.

    ``hang=True`` models a child that outlives its deadline — the timeout and
    cancellation cases both need one. Its readers are fed the canned output but
    NOT closed, so the drain delivers whatever the child had printed and then
    blocks forever on the open pipe, exactly like a real transfer still running;
    the caller's ``asyncio.wait_for`` bound is what ends it, so a test's
    wall-clock cost is the bound the code under test chose and nothing more.

    ``kill()`` closes both pipes, because that is what killing the process GROUP
    does — every inherited copy of the write fd goes with it, which is the only
    reason the post-kill drain can reach EOF instead of hanging. Without
