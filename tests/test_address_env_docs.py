"""Guards on the documented split between the two address environment variables.

``COMFYUI_URL`` and ``COMFY_LOCAL_URL`` read like two spellings of one knob and
are not: only the first is **ours**. ``_comfy_target`` reads ``COMFYUI_URL`` /
``COMFYUI_HOST`` / ``COMFYUI_PORT`` and forwards ``--host`` / ``--port``;
``COMFY_LOCAL_URL`` is comfy-cli's own variable, resolved inside comfy-cli off
the environment ``_comfy_env`` forwards, and this server never reads it at all.

That asymmetry is the reason neither name is being renamed, and it lives only in
README prose — no functional test would notice the section going stale, and a
future "strip the word local" pass would happily rename a variable this repo does
not own. These assertions are that tripwire: they key on the SPLIT (who reads
what) rather than on wording, so the section can be rewritten freely.
